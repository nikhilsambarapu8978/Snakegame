# Snake Game

## Overview

This Snake Game is implemented using Python and the Pygame library. It replicates the classic Snake game experience that was popular on Nokia phones in the 1990s and 2000s. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food and growing in size. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake to collect food and grow in size.
- **Boundary Wrapping**: The snake wraps around the screen when it moves beyond the edges.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with the snake's own body, resulting in a game over.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases by 10 points each time the snake eats food.
